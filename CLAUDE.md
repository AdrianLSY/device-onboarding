# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

Personal dotfiles plus a bootstrap installer (`setup.sh`) for setting up a fresh machine on **macOS, Linux, or Windows**. The repo lives at an **external** path (canonically `~/.dotfiles`), **not** at `~/.config` — on macOS/Linux `setup.sh` deploys config *into* `~/.config` by per-app **symlink** (`~/.config/<app>` → `~/.dotfiles/<tier>/<app>`), so editing through the symlink is still a repo edit. Windows has no single `~/.config`, so it deploys by an explicit manifest to heterogeneous targets (see the Windows tier below).

Content is split into OS **tiers**:

- `macos/` — the macOS machine's world: app configs (`zsh/`, `zed/`, `ghostty/`, `aerospace/`, `linearmouse/`, `vivaldi/`, `bin/`, `micro/`, `starship.toml`) **and** its own `setup/` (`brew`, `tweak`).
- `linux/` — the Linux (Arch/CachyOS) machine's world: app configs (`fish/`, `hypr/`, `waybar/`, `kitty/`, `mako/`, `rofi/`, `swaylock/`, `nvim/`, `btop/`, `tmux/`, `gtk-3.0/`, `gtk-4.0/`, `qt5ct/`, `qt6ct/`, `zed/`, `micro/`, `mimeapps.list`) **and** its own `setup/` (`pacman`, `yay`, `flatpak`, `app`, `asdf`, `tweak`).
- `windows/` — the native-Windows (Git Bash/MSYS) machine's world: its `setup/` (`winget`, `tweak`) plus a `.links` deploy manifest. **Runs under Git Bash**, selected when `uname -s` reports `MINGW*`/`MSYS*`/`CYGWIN*` (WSL reports `Linux` and gets the `linux` tier). App configs are deployed per the `windows/.links` manifest (`<app>\t<destination>`, destinations under `$HOME/.config`/`$APPDATA`/`$LOCALAPPDATA`/`$USERPROFILE`) rather than enumerated into one `~/.config`. Ships with cascade + deploy plumbing and a full `winget` package set; no app configs yet. **Prerequisites:** Git Bash, the `winget` client, and Developer Mode (for native symlinks).

`lib/link.sh` is the shared symlink helper (bootstrap *code*, not config). Repo meta lives at the root and is **never** symlinked into `~/.config`: `setup.sh`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `.claude/`, `graphify-out/`, `SECURE_BOOT.md`, `.gitattributes`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. (`openspec/` also sits at the root but is **gitignored** — local-only change proposals/specs, not part of the deployed dotfiles.)

**Branches:** a **single branch** now carries both machines; OS is chosen at **runtime** via `uname -s`, not by a branch checkout. (This retired the old branch-per-OS model where `main` = macOS and `cachyos-home` = Linux, which carried a "never merge wholesale" footgun — impossible now that OS-specific files live in disjoint tier dirs.)

## Design decision: two tiers, no shared config tier

There is intentionally **no `common/`/`shared/` config tier**. Genuinely-shared config is duplicated per tier: `micro/` is byte-identical in both; `zed/` is duplicated with a per-tier `settings.json` (they diverge). A change to a shared file must be made in both tiers. The sanctioned escape hatch if this ever stings is a single **intra-repo, tier-to-tier symlink** (e.g. `linux/micro` → `../macos/micro`) — **not** a new `common/` tier.

## Bootstrap flow

`./setup.sh` is the entry point. Clone the repo anywhere (canonically `~/.dotfiles`) and run it — there is no in-place/skip case; it always deploys by symlink. It cascades:

1. **Top-level `setup.sh`** (the dispatcher) — refuses to run as root; detects the OS via `uname -s` → tier (`macos`|`linux`|`windows`); on Windows runs a **preflight** first (fails fast, before any mutation, if `winget` is missing or a native symlink can't be created — i.e. Developer Mode off); runs a **repo-scoped, mode-preserving** `chmod u+rwX` (a `find` over the repo that **prunes `.git`**, never touching `~/.config`; capital `X` adds execute only to already-executable files, so tracked-as-644 files stay 644 and a bootstrap never dirties `git status` with mode flips; a no-op on Windows/NTFS); on macOS **ensures Command Line Tools**; then sources `lib/link.sh` and deploys — macOS/Linux call `deploy_tier "$TIER_DIR" "$HOME/.config"`; Windows exports `MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict` and calls `deploy_manifest "$TIER_DIR" "$TIER_DIR/.links"`; then runs `<tier>/setup/.setup.sh` capturing the real status through the `tee` pipe (guarded by `if` so `set -euo pipefail` can't abort before `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` is read) and exits with that true status.
2. **`<tier>/setup/.setup.sh`** — runs sub-modules in the order declared by its own `ORDER` array. macOS: `brew` then `tweak`. Linux: `pacman`, `yay`, `flatpak`, `app`, `asdf`, then `tweak`. Windows: `winget` then `tweak`. Each module is a directory with its own `.setup.sh`. Modules are **sibling processes**, so env established inside one module dies with it — the macOS tier runner therefore calls `ensure_brew_path` (eval `brew shellenv`, probing `/opt/homebrew` then `/usr/local`) before **each** module, so on a fresh machine the tweak phase can see brew-installed CLIs (`duti`, `uv`, `pre-commit` → the gitleaks hook) that the brew module just installed.
3. **`<tier>/setup/<pkgmgr>/.setup.sh`** — iterates its sibling `*.sh` scripts. For the name-based skip-checks (brew, pacman, yay, winget), **the filename minus `.sh` must equal the identifier the manager lists by** so an already-installed package isn't reinstalled: `brew list` / `pacman -Q` / `yay -Q` match a package **leaf name** (e.g. `aws-cli-v2.sh`, because the package is `aws-cli-v2` — naming it `aws.sh` would reinstall every run), while `winget list --id "$PKG" -e` matches the **full dotted winget id** (so a Windows install script is named e.g. `Mozilla.Firefox.sh`). Fresh-machine provisions inside the runners: the Linux `app` runner prepends `~/.local/bin:~/.pulumi/bin` to `PATH` so its `command -v` skip-checks see tools that user-local installers dropped there; the `flatpak` runner bootstraps the `flathub` remote (`remote-add --if-not-exists`) before installing; the `asdf` runner creates `~/.tool-versions` if missing (its scripts `sed -i` that file).
4. **`<tier>/setup/tweak/.setup.sh`** — same iteration, no skip-check; tweaks must be idempotent (`defaults write`, `duti -s` on macOS; `systemctl`, `ufw`, etc. on Linux) **and non-destructive** (back up user files like `_link_one` does — see `zsh.sh` — never `rm` them). Security-sensitive tweaks either follow least privilege (`hidraw.sh` uses seat-scoped `uaccess` ACLs, not `0666`) or carry an explicit documented decision in-file (`ufw.sh` disables the firewall deliberately and loudly; `sshd.sh` sets `UsePAM no` deliberately and validates with `sshd -t` before ever reloading).

Each runner captures stdout+stderr to `<script>.log` via `tee`, uses `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` for the real exit (not `tee`'s), deletes the log on success, retains it on failure, and prints an aggregate `❌ Failed: …` / `✅ Installed: …` summary. **Preserve this pattern when editing.**

## Symlink deploy (`lib/link.sh`)

Both deploy modes share ONE backup-then-link primitive, `_link_one <src> <dst>`:

- already the correct symlink → **no-op** (idempotent; creates no backup);
- exists as a real dir/file, a foreign symlink, or a broken symlink → `mv` to `<dst>.bak.<timestamp>` (with a numeric suffix if that name is taken), then symlink;
- absent → symlink (creating the destination's parent dir first, for nested Windows targets).

`_link_one` is **non-destructive** (never `rm -rf` a real target). Two callers:

- **`deploy_tier <tier_dir> <target_dir>`** (macOS/Linux) — enumerates the **direct children** of the tier dir, skipping the reserved `setup/` dir, and links each into the single `<target_dir>` (`~/.config`). It **never touches unmanaged `~/.config` entries** (only iterates tier entries, so `gh/`, `uv/`, `raycast/`, etc. are left alone).
- **`deploy_manifest <tier_dir> <manifest>`** (Windows) — reads `windows/.links` (`<app>\t<destination>[\t# inline comment]` — anything after a **second TAB** is discarded as a comment; `#` comment lines and blank lines skipped, whitespace trimmed), expands a **leading** env reference in the destination via `_expand_dest` (only `$HOME/.config`/`$HOME`/`$APPDATA`/`$LOCALAPPDATA`/`$USERPROFILE`; no `eval`, no globbing), and links each app to its own destination. A manifest line whose source is missing (or which has no destination) is reported and skipped without aborting the rest, and makes the function return non-zero. The manifest file and `windows/setup/` are never deployed.

Rollback is per-app in both modes: remove the symlink, restore its `.bak.<ts>`.

## Adding things

- **New package:** create `<tier>/setup/<pkgmgr>/<pkg>.sh` (macOS `brew`; Linux `pacman`/`yay`/`flatpak`/`asdf`/`app`; Windows `winget`) that installs it. For name-based managers the **filename minus `.sh` must equal the skip-check identifier** — the package leaf name for brew/pacman/yay, the **full dotted winget id** for winget (e.g. `Mozilla.Firefox.sh`, installed with `winget install --id "$PKG" -e --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements`). For tapped brew casks, `brew tap` + `brew trust --tap` inside the script.
- **New Windows app config:** create `windows/<app>/`, then add a `windows/.links` line mapping it to its destination — unlike macOS/Linux, Windows config is NOT auto-tracked-and-deployed by directory; it needs an explicit manifest line.
- **New system tweak:** create `<tier>/setup/tweak/<name>.sh`. Runs every bootstrap — make it idempotent.
- **New app config:** create `<app>/` under the relevant tier (`macos/` or `linux/`). **No `.gitignore` allowlisting needed** — the conventional deny-list tracks it automatically. It's symlinked into `~/.config/<app>` on the next `setup.sh`.
- **New zsh function/alias (macOS):** drop a `<name>.zsh` in `macos/zsh/rc.d/`. `.zshrc` sources all of them. The Linux/fish equivalent is a `<name>.fish` in `linux/fish/conf.d/`.

## Runtime-state hazard (important)

Because `~/.config/<app>` is a whole-dir symlink, anything an app **writes** into its config dir lands in the repo working tree. The most frequent offender: **zsh self-compiles `.zshrc` → `.zshrc.zwc` in `$ZDOTDIR` on every shell start**. Such runtime/generated paths MUST be kept out of git via the conventional `.gitignore` (already covers `**/zsh/*.zwc`, `**/zsh/.zsh_history`, `**/micro/backups/`, `**/micro/buffers/`, `**/fish/fish_variables`, etc.) and/or folded to a per-file symlink pointing at `~/.local/state/<app>/`. When adding a config dir whose app writes state in place, add the ignore rule.

## `.gitignore` (conventional deny-list)

`.gitignore` is a **conventional deny-list** (everything tracked by default; cruft/logs/runtime-state ignored) — **not** the old allowlist. New tracked dirs need no `!` entries. One special case is preserved: only `graphify-out/graph.json` is tracked (`graphify-out/*` ignored, `!graphify-out/graph.json`), since the rest of `graphify-out/` is machine-specific or regenerable.

## zsh layout (macOS)

`macos/setup/tweak/zsh.sh` writes `~/.zshenv` to set `ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.config/zsh` — and `~/.config/zsh` is now a symlink to `macos/zsh`, so the whole shell config still lives in this repo. The tweak is non-destructive and idempotent: a pre-existing `~/.zshrc`/`~/.zprofile` is moved to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>` (never deleted; only compiled `*.zwc` artifacts are removed outright), and `~/.zshenv` is only rewritten when its content differs, so a re-run touches nothing. `.zprofile` sets up Homebrew. `.zshrc` loads zinit, starship, autocomplete/autosuggestions/syntax-highlighting (the latter two `wait lucid`), zoxide as `cd`, then sources `rc.d/`.

## Multi-account git (`macos/zsh/rc.d/git-multi-account.zsh`, `linux/fish/conf.d/git-multi-account.fish`)

`git` is shadowed by a function that intercepts `clone`, `submodule add`, `submodule init`, `submodule update`. It parses the GitHub URL, resolves which of two accounts (`Adrian-LSY` for rooftop.my work, `AdrianLSY` for personal) has push access via `gh api`, runs the underlying git command with `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` pointing at the right key, then stamps that account's identity + SSH-signing config onto the resulting repo and every submodule. `ghs <account>` re-stamps the current repo. Keep the `command git ...` calls — bare `git` would recurse. The two account names appear in three case statements plus the resolution logic; update all together. There are **two parallel implementations** (zsh for macOS, fish for Linux) — keep them in sync.

## Other notable bits

- `ghp "msg"`: `git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push` (sets upstream on first push).
- `ghu`: on the current repo + every submodule in parallel, fetches origin, fast-forwards (or hard-resets) the default branch, deletes branches whose upstreams are gone.
- `ai`: alias for `claude --settings '{"ultracode":true}' --dangerously-skip-permissions`. The `--settings '{"ultracode":true}'` turns on ultracode (xhigh effort + standing dynamic-workflow orchestration) at launch — the only way to activate it from the CLI (`--effort ultracode` collapses to plain `xhigh`; ultracode is session-scoped).
- `macos/aerospace/aerospace.toml` references `adrianlsy.github.io/AeroSpace` — a personal fork (`AdrianLSY/tap/aerospace-adrianlsy`), not upstream `nikitabobko/AeroSpace`. Hover-to-raise (`[auto-raise]`) is fork-specific.
- **Stay awake on AC (`macos/setup/tweak/ac-stay-awake.sh`):** closing the lid sleeps this Mac even on AC, killing long-running Claude Code sessions. Clamshell sleep ignores `PreventSystemSleep`/`caffeinate` assertions, so the only lever is pmset's undocumented system-wide `SleepDisabled` flag (`pmset -g` reports it; it is absent from `man pmset`). The tweak installs a `local.ac-stay-awake` LaunchAgent that **reconciles** the flag with the power source every 30s and at load: AC → 1, battery → 0. Reconciling (not reacting to plug/unplug events) is deliberate — the dangerous failure mode is the flag stuck at 1 on battery, which would reintroduce the 4%/hr lid-closed drain, and a state reconciler cannot get stuck. Needs root, so it uses a NOPASSWD sudoers drop-in scoped to exactly `pmset disablesleep 0|1` (staged to `~/.local/state/ac-stay-awake.sudoers`; the tweak prints the `sudo install` command rather than running it). Transitions log to `~/.local/state/ac-stay-awake.log`. ⚠ Set AlDente's "Prevent Overcharging During Sleep" to **"Stop Charging when Sleeping"** — its "Disable Sleep until Charge Limit" writes the same global flag (and only holds sleep off until the limit, so it cannot provide this feature anyway). Trade-off accepted: the Mac never sleeps while plugged in, a thermal/wear cost on a fanless Air. Rollback: `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/local.ac-stay-awake`, remove the plist + `~/.local/bin/ac-stay-awake` + `/etc/sudoers.d/ac-stay-awake`, then `sudo pmset disablesleep 0`.
- **Sleep freeze (`macos/setup/tweak/sleep-freeze.sh` + brew `sleepwatcher`):** Claude Code CLI sessions hold ~30+ TLS connections and poll on timers, overflowing the Wi-Fi chip's sleep offload budget — 4.3%/hr lid-closed drain vs ~0.1%/hr once frozen. The tweak writes `~/.sleep`/`~/.wakeup` hooks that SIGSTOP every process named exactly `claude` at system sleep and SIGCONT on wake. Deny-by-default: nothing else is signaled (Apple daemons on the Find My path are never listed and are unsignalable from a user-level hook anyway), so Find My keeps working (`tcpkeepalive` untouched — verified live). Counts log to `~/.local/state/sleepwatcher.log` ("0 pid(s)" with sessions open = pattern rot). Rollback: `brew services stop sleepwatcher && rm ~/.sleep ~/.wakeup`. ⚠ **Do not add GUI apps** — SIGSTOP does not close sockets, so inbound-push storms are immune to freezing; a six-app expansion was tested over two nights and reverted (see the tweak's SCOPE LIMIT header). ⚠ Dry-run hook changes from a neutral launchd context (`launchctl submit -l probe -- /bin/sh <script>`) using `lsof -b`: Claude-spawned shells report false zero-matches and plain `lsof` hangs on the WebDAV mount.
- Secrets: a **gitleaks pre-commit hook** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, wired up by the brew module) scans staged changes and blocks commits containing secrets. Unlike the old allowlist, the conventional `.gitignore` no longer gates tracking by directory, so the gitleaks hook is the primary content-level defense — keep it installed (`pre-commit install`).
- **Line endings:** `.gitattributes` pins `*.sh`, `setup.sh`, and `windows/.links` to **`eol=lf`** — all three are parsed by bash (macOS/Linux, and Git Bash/MSYS on Windows), where a stray CRLF breaks shebang parsing and leaves a trailing `\r` on manifest fields. `deploy_manifest` strips `\r` defensively anyway, but the attribute keeps the tracked files clean at the source. (The same file also carries the pre-existing `graphify-out/graph.json merge=graphify` union-merge driver.)

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
